#             updates of it are then invoked in the game loop, which should be called outside

# @class PGScene
# @abstract Base class for all scene objects in the game.
# @discussion This class provides base APIs to be invoked by SSGame and overridden
#             by subclasses. All subclass buttons should eventually be added to
#             @self._buttons and sprites to @self._sprites so that they may be
#             centrally updated. Note that when transitioning to a new scene, the
#             PGAnimations utilities could be employed for visual effects. In addition,
#             a previous scene should ONLY activate a new scene, as the completion
#             would be handled from within.
